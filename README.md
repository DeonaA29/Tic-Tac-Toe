 Tic Tac Toe Web Application

 Project Description

This project is part of Task 03 from my SkillCraft Technology Internship.
The Tic Tac Toe Web Application is an interactive and user-friendly game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows two players to play alternately, automatically detects the winner or a draw, and provides the option to restart the game.




 Features

Two-player interactive gameplay

 Automatic winner and draw detection

 Restart button to play again

 Real-time UI updates

 Clean, modern, and responsive design





Technologies Used

HTML5 – For the structure of the game board

CSS3 – For styling and layout design

JavaScript (ES6) – For implementing game logic and interactions





How It Works

1. Players take turns clicking on the grid.


2. The app checks for a win or draw condition after every move.


3. If a player wins, the result is displayed (e.g., “X Wins 🎉”).


4. The Restart button resets the board for a new game.
